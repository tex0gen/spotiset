# Spotiset

Search for an artist or a DJ set and select the setlist you are looking for.
Spotiset will automatically grab those tracks from Spotify if they exist on the platform.
Automatically create a playlist based on the entire set or select individual tracks from the setlist to build your playlist from.

To run:

``cd spotiset``
``npm install``
``cd spotiset/backend``
``npm install``
``cd ../``
``npm start``
